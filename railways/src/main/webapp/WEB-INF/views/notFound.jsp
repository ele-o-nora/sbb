        No roads ran through the twisted mountain valleys where they walked now.
        Between the grey stone peaks lay still blue lakes, long and deep and narrow,
        and the green gloom of endless piney woods. The russet and gold of autumn leaves
        grew less common when they left the wolfswood to climb amongst the old flint hills,
        and vanished by the time those hills had turned to mountains.
        Giant grey-green sentinels loomed above them now, and spruce and fir and soldier pines
        in endless profusion. The undergrowth was sparse beneath them,
        the forest floor carpeted in dark green needles.

        When they lost their way, as happened once or twice,
        they need only wait for a clear cold night when the clouds did not intrude,
        and look up in the sky for the Ice Dragon.

        The gloom was deepening around them. Lantern bugs moved slowly through the trees,
        their little lights like so many drifting stars. There were stars in the sky as well,
        more stars than any man could ever hope to count,
        even if he lived to be as old as King Jaehaerys.
        Dunk need only lift his eyes to find familiar friends:
        the Stallion and the Sow, the King's Crown and the Crone's Lantern,
        the Galley, Ghost, and Moonmaid. But there were clouds to the north,
        and the blue eye of the Ice Dragon was lost to him, the blue eye that pointed north.
